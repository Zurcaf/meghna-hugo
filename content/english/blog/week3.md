This week we had the opportunity to interview sound technicias who work for Watt-Light, the company that was hired by the Electrical and Computer Engineering student team for their anual event. The main focus of the conversation was the software they are currently using; we learned that there are features which can be improved.

The process of analyzing space and planning the PA (Public Address) system involves using software such as d&b ArrayCalc for 3D space dimensioning, considering parameters like air temperature and material properties. The software is a comprehensive tool for acoustical project design, performance prediction, alignment, assembly, and safety parameters.
Additionally, the d&b NoizCalc software is used to simulate how sound will propagate for a specific PA. It utilizes data from the d&b ArrayCalc simulation, creating a noise gridmap for outdoor events.

The sound analysis, once the PA is set up, is conducted at specific points. A technician selects a point in the software for measurement, and another technician goes to the corresponding physical location to analyze the sound using a measurement microphone. This data is then stored in the software to improve simulations and maintain a record of sound at that point.

Several questions are raised, suggesting the potential for improvements. It would be advantageous to eliminate the need for manually selecting points in the software, instead instructing the moving technician to go to the desired point. Additionally, there is interest in obtaining continuous and automatic measurements, which could enhance simulations and automate data recording. Besides, there is limited development, particularly in Portugal, for alternatives in the market. 

> In conclusion, there is an opportunity to implement a feasible solution focused on sampling and recording points in space rather than estimating sound propagation. A prototype for such a solution could offer valuable information within the space covered by the PA.

Once finished, a prototype that independently deals with these issues can easily be adjusted to work with this software.
