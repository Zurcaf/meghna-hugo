In the 4th week of the project we met with our project's assistent, Professor Rafael Cordeiro to discuss the goals for the intermediate delivery of April 1st.

Goals set at the meeting of 8/3/2024:
* acquire signals with the RP2040 Arduino board;
* extract these signals to a computer;
* differentiate two signals and, therefore, two sounds based on intensity readings and, if possible, frequency analysis.

The next stage of the project was also discussed and many options were discussed for the mapping and localization of our sensor.
Possible technologies for mapping and navigation:
* LIDAR
* Extended Kalman Filter

We verified the specifications of our first prototype's microphone - MP3DT06JTR.
We came into contact with a professional software (d&b ArrayCalc) that maps showrooms and simulates sound propagation in them.
One possibility to be decided in further meetings is the usage of this software.
