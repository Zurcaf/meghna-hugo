Directories:
	hugo.toml -> configuration file (also affects top and bottom strips)
	static -> all files that are not webpages; images, documents, etc. 
	public -> stores the site
	public/images/ -> also has the images
	data/en -> all the modules of the page
	content/english/blog -> blog posts (in english); to create a new blog post, copy a previous one and change it
	i18n/en.yaml -> top strip (except logo)
	public/author/index.html -> favicon
		public/categories/index.html -> favicon
		public/author/john-doe/index.html -> favicon
		public/author/mark-dinn/index.html -> favicon
		public/blog/index.html -> favicon
		public/blog/page/2/index.html -> favicon

Commands:
	hugo server (noHTTPCache) -> generates an example of the website (changes in real-time)
	hugo -> puts website on public (which then should be uploaded to the server)

Modules from top to bottom:
	banner.yml
	about.yml (false)
	feature.yml (false)
	cta.yml (false)
	service.yml 
	skill.yml (false)
	portfolio.yml (false)
	funfacts.yml (false)
	team.yml
	pricing.yml (false)
	testimonial.yml (false)
	contact.yml

In order to add new files, connect with the server via ssh and copy them to the /web/ directory (this also applies to blog content).
	For example:
		- copy images from ~/web/meghna-hugo/images/ to ~/web/images; (TALVEZ SEJA AO CONTR√ÅRIO; CONFIRMAR)
		- copy blog posts from
	Or even better: cp -ru ~/web/meghna-hugo/* ~/web/

Irrelevant directories and files:
	archetypes/
	resources/
